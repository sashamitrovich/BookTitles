# Purnote

Purnote is a hobby iOS 14 app I built for the purpose of learning Swift and SwiftUI


## Features:

* take your notes and they get directly saved to the iCloud Drive, in the directory called "purnote"
* use the MarkDown notation for notes and they will be rendered by the App (thanks to  project https://github.com/dasautoooo/Parma by https://github.com/dasautoooo)
* organize notes in folders
* notes get automatically synced with your Mac
* edit or create the notes directly on your Mac and they will be updated in the app
* search all your notes within the app. For this I've built a naive inverted implementations (naive because there's no score relevance) that indexes all your notes
